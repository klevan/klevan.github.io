I'm a scientist. I escaped grad school largely unscathed. Gained some coding skills along the way. Ask me anything about ants and I may have something intelligible to say on the subject (this is a hit at parties). 

## My approach is all about:

* Cultivating curiosity
* Using data to answer questions
* Intelligent experimental design
