# Life in a riparian ecosystem changed by ant invasion

Riparian ecosystems are a vital habitat for humans and native wildlife. Humans enjoy the water purification and stream stabilization services provided by riparian ecosystems, while many creatures depend on this habitat for food, water, or places to nest. Streams can traverse a large area; as a result, this habitat can increase connectivity between wildlife preserves or other intact areas.

**Pictured below**: A typical view of a riparian area at Dawson Los Monos Reserve, Carlsbad, CA.

In moist riparian ecosystems, the invasive Argentine ant is unencumbered by the usual physical limitations it faces in [hotter and drier environments](http://people.biology.ucsd.edu/smenke/Menke_Holway%20JAE%202006.pdf). Because of this, the Argentine ant freely invades the areas alongside streams and displaces all the native ants that occur there. This loss of native ant communities is [well documented](http://invasivespecies.ucsd.edu/pubs/Holway-D.A._1998_1.pdf). However, it is less clear whether other classes of animals also decline (or become more abundant) where Argentine ants invade.

During surveys of ant communities in southern California, we found riparian areas where the Argentine ants were advancing forward from an invasion front, but had not yet eradicated native ants from the riverside habitat. We used this briefly available opportunity to see if insects that interact frequently with ants were affected by the substitution of ant species and reduction in ant diversity.

**Pictured below**: On arroyo willow, native ants (*Tapinoma sessile*) protect aphids and collect their honeydew (partially digested plant sap excreted by the aphids).

Many aphid species exchange honeydew for protection from their enemies. Argentine ants (like native ant species) also collect honeydew, because it is sugar rich and fuels the colony (click to read more about the role of [carbohydrates](http://invasivespecies.ucsd.edu/pubs/Tillberg-C.V._2007.pdf) and invasion success). Interestly, we found that Argentine ants only tended one species of aphid (within the genus *Chaitophorus*), but native ants tended a number of aphid species.

**Pictured above**: *Formica* tend *Chaitophorus* aphids on willows.

Now, using molecular techniques, we are revealing the effects of ant diversity loss on other taxa. Results seemed to indicate that aphid and parasitoid diversity was reduced in areas with Argentine ants compared to adjacent sites with native ants. This difference appears to result from a lower diversity pool of aphid hosts that parasitic wasps must choose from rather than any superior protection offered by the Argentine ant.

**Pictured above**: Under the microscope, an unparasitized aphid (upper) has an intact abdomen. If an aphid is parasitized by a wasp, the wasp egg hatches and the larvae grows until it occupies the majority of the interior of the aphid body (lower).
