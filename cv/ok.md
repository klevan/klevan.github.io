# Katherine E. LeVan

## Relevant Experience

### Data Scientist

**National Ecological Observatory Network:** Staff Scientist (Current)

Principal scientist heading the Insect Ecology sampling program for an NSF-funded national observatory.

* Developed pipelines and scripts to deliver quality data products on a public data portal; algorithms performed numerous QA/QC checks and modifications on raw data 
* Co-managed a large (~100 full-time, ~200 seasonal) team of technicians implementing collection protocols in the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico
* Created training materials 

## Technical Experience

Programming Platforms and Languages

:   **R:** Six years experience programming in R. Projects have included the development of internally-facing R packages, coding scripts to scrape websites and access large data repositories, 

:   **GitHub:** Collaborative work on algorithm development within a 24 person team; resulting code capable of ingesting data from many sources (e.g., field collected data, laboratory analyses), performing quality checks to process/flag errors and outputing 

:   Also familiar with **Python**, **SQL**, **CSS**

## Education
2008 - 2013

:   PhD, Biology *University of California, San Diego (La Jolla, CA)*

2004 - 2008    

:   BS, Biology & Spanish *Tufts University (Medford, MA)*

## Workshops and Presentations
2015
:   **Entomological Society of America** *Big Data Meets Insect Ecology: Examining Insects Continentally
using NEON Data and R* 

* Conducted an interactive workshop with 50+ attendees exploring time-series data in R. Workshop incorporated techniques such as data visualization (i.e., non-metric multidimensional scaling) and statistical analysis (i.e., permutational analysis of variance) 

2013
:   **Ecological Society of America** Presented results of a network analysis at the annual ecology meeting; study combined field ecology, molecular analysis and network statistics to reveal negative effects of invasive species on mutualistic networks.
