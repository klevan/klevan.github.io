## Relevant Experience

### Data Scientist

**National Ecological Observatory Network** *Boulder, CO* Staff Scientist (Feb 2015 - Present)

Principal scientist heading the Insect Ecology sampling program for an NSF-funded national observatory

* Develops pipelines and scripts to deliver quality data products on a public data portal (e.g., Mosquito diversity and pathogen-status); algorithms performed numerous QA/QC checks and modifications on raw data (data available [here](http://data.neonscience.org/browse-data?showTheme=org) from the NEON data portal)
* Co-manages a large (~100 full-time, ~400 seasonal) team of technicians implementing collection protocols in the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico
* Creates training materials 

## Technical Experience

Programming Platforms and Languages

:   **R.** Ten years experience programming in R. Projects have included the development of internally-facing R packages, coding scripts to scrape websites and access large data repositories (see my posts about [BOLD](//klevan.github.io/BOLD-sequence-data/) and [AntWeb](//klevan.github.io/antweb-exploration/) for examples)

:   **GitHub.** Collaborative work on algorithm development within a 24 person team; resulting code capable of ingesting data from many sources (e.g., field collected data, laboratory analyses), performing quality checks to process/flag errors
