# Katherine E. LeVan

## Relevant Experience

### Data Scientist

**National Ecological Observatory Network:** Staff Scientist (Current)

Principal scientist heading the Insect Ecology sampling program for an NSF-funded national observatory.

* Develops pipelines and scripts to deliver quality data products on a public data portal; algorithms performed numerous QA/QC checks and modifications on raw data 
* Co-manages a large (~100 full-time, ~400 seasonal) team of technicians implementing collection protocols in the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico
* Creates training materials 

## Technical Experience

Programming Platforms and Languages

:   **R:** Seven years experience programming in R. Projects have included the development of internally-facing R packages, coding scripts to scrape websites and access large data repositories (see my posts about [BOLD](//klevan.github.io/BOLD-sequence-data/) and [AntWeb](//klevan.github.io/antweb-exploration/) for examples)

:   **GitHub:** Collaborative work on algorithm development within a 24 person team; resulting code capable of ingesting data from many sources (e.g., field collected data, laboratory analyses), performing quality checks to process/flag errors

:   Also familiar with **Python**, **SQL**, **CSS**

## Education
2008 - 2013

:   PhD, Biology *University of California, San Diego* (La Jolla, CA)

Thesis: "The broader ecological effects of species invasion on protection mutualisms"

2004 - 2008    

:   BS, Biology & Spanish *Tufts University* (Medford, MA)

## Workshops and Presentations
2015
:   **Entomological Society of America** [*Big Data Meets Insect Ecology: Examining Insects Continentally
using NEON Data and R*](http://entsoc.org/PDF/2015/2015_ESA_Annual_Meeting_Program.pdf)

* Conducted an interactive workshop with 50+ attendees exploring time-series data in R. Workshop incorporated techniques such as data visualization (i.e., non-metric multidimensional scaling) and statistical analysis (i.e., permutational analysis of variance) 

2014
:   **Ecological Society of America** ["Ant-aphid mutualisms increase ant floral visitation and reduce plant reproduction via decreased pollinator visitation"](http://esa.org/meetings_archive/2014/webprogram/Paper47631.html)


2013
:   **Ecological Society of America** Presented [results of a network analysis](http://esa.org/meetings_archive/2013/webprogram/Paper41526.html) at the annual ecology meeting; study combined field ecology, molecular analysis and network statistics to reveal negative effects of invasive species on mutualistic networks


2011-2012
: **Ecological Society of America** Presented on a variety of projects to national audience of ecologists

* ["The broader ecological effects of aphid tending by the Argentine ant"](http://esa.org/meetings_archive/2012/webprogram/Paper36315.html)

* ["Do mutualisms between the Argentine ant and cotton aphids structure arthropod food webs in cotton?"](http://esa.org/meetings_archive/2011/webprogram/Paper31841.html)

## Teaching Experience

2014 Explore Ecology, 

* Instructed 850 students at the K-6 level, created and delivered inquiry-based curriculum that emphasized California natural history, plant biology and evolution

2012 Reuben H. Fleet Science Center, San Diego: K-8 Teacher Institute

* Led a 90 minute workshop teaching STEM methods to 25 K-8 educators.

2009-2012 University of California, San Diego: Introduction to Research

* Personally mentored 24 students in their independent research in the Holway lab. Many were from underserved populations (16 women, 2 Native Americans, 3 Hispanics, 1 Hawaiian) and 25% pursued graduate school afterward.

2011 University of California, San Diego: Introduction to Ecology

* Head teaching assistant for Dr. Jon Shurin, led discussion sections, graded exams, led review sessions.

2011 University of California, San Diego: Biometry: Instructor for two lab sections for 25 students each. 

* Labs teach basic statistical methods, appropriate applications and R statistical software.

2010 University of California, San Diego: Ecosystems and Global Change

* Teaching assistant for Dr. Elsa Cleland for a class of 175 students, led two discussion sections of 30 students each, graded problem sets and exams. 

2006-2008 Tufts University: Organisms and Populations 

* Taught lab sections with 26 students. Labs explore the field of organismal biology, with emphasis on major disciplines within the field (i.e. microscopy, taxonomy, bioinformatics, genetics, evolution, physiology, and anatomy).
