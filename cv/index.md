## Relevant Experience

### Data Scientist

**National Ecological Observatory Network** *Boulder, CO* Staff Scientist (Feb 2015 - Present)

Principal scientist heading the Insect Ecology sampling program for an NSF-funded national observatory

* Develops pipelines and scripts to deliver quality data products on a public data portal (e.g., Mosquito diversity and pathogen-status); algorithms performed numerous QA/QC checks and modifications on raw data (data available [here](http://data.neonscience.org/browse-data?showTheme=org) from the NEON data portal)
* Co-manages a large (~100 full-time, ~400 seasonal) team of technicians implementing collection protocols in the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico
* Creates training materials 

## Technical Experience

Programming Platforms and Languages

:   **R.** Nine years experience programming in R. Projects have included the development of internally-facing R packages, coding scripts to scrape websites and access large data repositories (see my posts about [BOLD](//klevan.github.io/BOLD-sequence-data/) and [AntWeb](//klevan.github.io/antweb-exploration/) for examples)

:   **GitHub.** Collaborative work on algorithm development within a 24 person team; resulting code capable of ingesting data from many sources (e.g., field collected data, laboratory analyses), performing quality checks to process/flag errors

![](//klevan.github.io/assets/images/github.png)

:   Also familiar with **Python**, **SQL**, **CSS**

Statistical Methods

:   **Parametric** methods including simple/multiple regression, ANOVA/ANCOVA, MANOVA/MANCOVA, t-tests, Pearson's correlation

:   **Non-parametric** methods including Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, Spearman's correlation, sign tests

:   **Ordination** techniques including Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling, Principal Component Analysis

:   Also familiar with **numerical** methods and **PerMANOVA**

Data Product Development

:   **ETL.** Develops all aspects of the data pipeline within a large team (195 data products planned for end of observatory construction); including specifying data ingest, processing and QA/QC checks, & data publication. 

## Education
2008 - 2013

:   PhD, Biology *University of California, San Diego* (La Jolla, CA)

:   Dissertation title: "The broader ecological effects of species invasion on protection mutualisms"

2004 - 2008    

:   BS, Biology & Spanish *Tufts University* (Medford, MA)

## Workshops and Presentations
2016
:  **The Nature Conservancy** invited talk, *The NEON project: Ecology meets Big Data at a Continental Scale*

2015
:   **Entomological Society of America** [*Big Data Meets Insect Ecology: Examining Insects Continentally
using NEON Data and R*](http://entsoc.org/PDF/2015/2015_ESA_Annual_Meeting_Program.pdf)

* Conducted an interactive 2-hr workshop with 50+ attendees exploring time-series data in R. Workshop incorporated techniques such as data visualization (i.e., non-metric multidimensional scaling) and statistical analysis (i.e., permutational analysis of variance) 

2011 - 2014
: **Ecological Society of America** Gave 4 presentations to a national audience of ecologists on a variety of research projects; see [1](https://eco.confex.com/eco/2014/webprogram/Paper47631.html), [2](https://eco.confex.com/eco/2013/webprogram/Paper41526.html), [3](https://eco.confex.com/eco/2012/webprogram/Paper36315.html), [4](https://eco.confex.com/eco/2011/webprogram/Paper31841.html)

* Presented [results of a network analysis](http://esa.org/meetings_archive/2013/webprogram/Paper41526.html) at the annual ecology meeting; study combined field ecology, molecular analysis and network statistics to reveal negative effects of invasive species on mutualistic networks
