## Relevant Experience

### Data Scientist

**National Ecological Observatory Network** *Boulder, CO* Staff Scientist (Feb 2015 - Present)

Principal scientist heading the Insect Ecology sampling program for an NSF-funded national observatory

* Develops pipelines and scripts to deliver quality data products on a public data portal (e.g., Mosquito diversity and pathogen-status); algorithms performed numerous QA/QC checks and modifications on raw data (data available [here](http://data.neonscience.org/browse-data?showTheme=org) from the NEON data portal)
* Co-manages a large (~100 full-time, ~400 seasonal) team of technicians implementing collection protocols in the continental US, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico
* Creates training materials 

## Technical Experience

Programming Platforms and Languages

:   **R.** Ten years experience programming in R. Projects have included the development of internally-facing R packages, coding scripts to scrape websites and access large data repositories (see my posts about [BOLD](//klevan.github.io/BOLD-sequence-data/) and [AntWeb](//klevan.github.io/antweb-exploration/) for examples)

:   **GitHub.** Collaborative work on algorithm development within a 24 person team; resulting code capable of ingesting data from many sources (e.g., field collected data, laboratory analyses), performing quality checks to process/flag errors

:   Also familiar with **Python**, **SQL**, **CSS**

Statistical Methods

:   **Parametric** methods including simple/multiple regression, ANOVA/ANCOVA, MANOVA/MANCOVA, t-tests, Pearson's correlation

:   **Non-parametric** methods including Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney, Spearman's correlation, sign tests

:   **Ordination** techniques including Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling, Principal Component Analysis

:   Also familiar with **numerical** methods and **PerMANOVA**

Data Product Development

:   **ETL.** Develops all aspects of the data pipeline within a large team (195 data products planned for end of observatory construction); including specifying data ingest, processing and QA/QC checks, & data publication.
