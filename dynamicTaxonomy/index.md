Beetles (family Coleoptera) are extremely diverse and, in some cases, difficult taxonomically. There are a number of good keys to North American taxa, but the language used in these keys is often specialized - putting the use of these keys outside the realm of casual users. Here, I have added additional information and photos to make these materials more accessible to someone without specific entomology training. The photos reproduced on this site are licensed for non-commercial reuse and their original source is referenced.
