# NEON projects

## Carabid distributions in 2014
I work at the National Ecological Observatory Network as a staff scientist. We are currently delivering beetle diversity and abundance data on our web portal at [neoninc.org](http://neoninc.org). I gave a workshop at the Entomological Society of America in November on patterns and trends in the data. You can look at the workshop notes on my site [here](carabid-workshop), but sometime in January that will be formalized into a #WorkWithData workshop on the [neondataskills.org](http://neondataskills.org) website. 

# Side Projects

## The beetle bot
This was a short coding project. The purpose was to make an automated tweet generator that would deliver facts about beetles (with photos) to my twitter feed. You can see the beetle bot (including how it works) [here](beetleBot/index.html). 

## Scraping species checklists from the USGS website

The USGS had collated species checklists of Tiger beetles from across the US. I used the 'rvest' package to extract distributional data (presence/absence) for individual counties within the US. Since I did this last Spring, the Northern Prarie Wildlife Research Center has completely changed their website and this data may actually be lost. :(
